# Get Started
Docs for this theme is under construction.
An example of the blog theme can be found here, with source code here.

 Similar to the Docs Theme, you can install the blog theme with the following commands:

## Quick Start from Template
Start as New Project
Install
To create a Nextra Docs site manually, you have to install Next.js, React, Nextra, and Nextra Blog Theme. In your project directory, run the following command to install the dependencies:

bun add next react react-dom nextra nextra-theme-blog

If you already have Next.js installed in your project, you only need to install nextra and nextra-theme-blog as the add-ons.

Add Next.js Config
Create the following next.config.js file in your projectâ€™s root directory:

Render the page title in
Show a simple table of contents
Add a meta tag for og:image via the front matter

## Use Page Map of the Entire Site
Now, if you want to render something like a sidebar or a navigation bar, which relies on information of not only the current page but also other pages, you can use the pageMap value.

For example, we can render a simple navigation list with all the pages in the top level:


## Next.js Link
All relative Markdown links are automatically converted to Next.js links. This means that the target page will be prefetched. And when you click on a link, the page will be loaded on the client-side like a SPA, without making a full page load. For example:

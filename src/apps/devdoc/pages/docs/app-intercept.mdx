# App Intercepts

Kloudlite provide a unique way for developers to shorten the development cycles. We can now intercept 
any running app in the environmnet with the workspace that is connected.

All the traffic to the application will be directed to the workspace.

With this feature we can now avoid building and deploying the applications into environments to test. 
You can intercept any application using following commands and start debugging and testing.

```shell
kl intercept
```

This command will prompt to choose the application service to intercept and port to forward it to.

> Note: All apps in the environment & workspaces connected to the environment will route to the intercepting 
workspace when attempting to access the intercepted application.

You can remove intercept from the dashboard or the following command

```shell
kl intercept stop
```

# Frontend

This is a guide to help the Kloudlite community and also Kloudlite members contribute to our UI. It is ongoing work but we hope it provides some useful information to get started. If you have any questions or need help, please send us a message on our [**Discord server**](https://github.com/kloudlite). We'll be happy to help you.

## Running the UI
You can run the UI and access the dashboard in two ways:
    
- Build the UI pointing to an external Coder server: CODER_HOST=https://mycoder.com pnpm dev inside of the site folder. This is helpful when you are building something in the UI and already have the data on your deployed server.
- Build the entire Coder server + UI locally: ./scripts/develop.sh in the root folder. It is useful when you have to contribute with features that are not deployed yet or when you have to work on both, frontend and backend.

In both cases, you can access the dashboard on http://localhost:8080. If you are running the ./scripts/develop.sh you can log in using the default credentials: admin@coder.com and SomeSecurePassword!

## Tech Stack
All our dependencies are described in site/package.json but here are the most important ones:

    - [**Remix**](https://remix.run) as framework
    - [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to keep our sanity
    - [**Radix UI**](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for UI components
    - [**Graphql**](https://graphql.org/) as fetching lib
    - [**Storybook**](https://storybook.js.org/) for visual testing
    - PNPM as package manager

## Structure
   All the code related to the UI is inside the `src` folder and we defined a few conventions to help people to navigate through it.
    - **src** - source code
        - **@types** - Custom types for dependencies that don't have defined types (largely code that has no server-side equivalent)
        - **api** - API code as function calls and types

            queries - react-query queries and mutations

        - **components** - UI components
        - **hooks** - Hooks that can be used across the application
        - **pages** - Page components
        - **testHelpers** - Helper functions to help with integration tests
        - **util** - Helper functions that can be used across the application

    - **design system** - Static UI assets like images, fonts, icons, etc
  
## Routing
We use [Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/routes) for routing. The routes are defined in the `routes.tsx` file.

## Pages
Pages are the top-level components of the app. The page component lives under the src/apps folder and each page should have its own folder so we can better group the views, tests, utility functions and so on. We use a structure where the page component is responsible for fetching all the data and passing it down to the view.

## States
A page usually has at least three states: **loading**, **ready/success**, and **error**, so always remember to handle these scenarios while you are coding a page. We use the `useOutletContext` hook to access the state from the parent component.

## fetching data
We use the `Graphql` api to fetch data. It provides a simple interface to fetch data from the server.It is used to fetch data from the server and update the state of the page. It also provides a way to handle errors and loading states.

- **useWatch**:
    The `useWatch` hook is used to watch for changes in the data and update the state of the page. It is used to watch for changes in the data and update the state of the page. It also provides a way to handle errors and loading states.

- **useWatchReload**:
The `useWatchReload` hook is used to watch for changes in the data and reload the page. It is used to watch for changes in the data and reload the page. It also provides a way to handle errors and loading states.

## API
We use the [**Graphql**](https://graphql.org/) as fetching library. It provides a simple interface to fetch data from the server.It is used to fetch data from the server and update the state of the page. It also provides a way to handle errors and loading states.
Our APi functions are defined in the `server/gql/queries` folder. Each function is a query that returns a GraphQL object. The functions are used to fetch data from the server and update the state of the page. It also provides a way to handle errors and loading states.

## Components
We use the [**Remix UI**](https://www.radix-ui.com/) as UI components. It provides a set of UI components that can be used to build the UI of the application. The components are defined in the `components` folder. Each component is a UI component that can be used to build the UI of the application. The components are used to build the UI of the application.

- ### Structure
Each component gets its own folder. Make sure you add a test and Storybook stories for the component as well. By keeping these tidy, the codebase will remain easy to navigate, healthy and maintainable for all contributors.

- ### Accessibility

<div className="wb-p-3xl wb-mt-3xl" />

# What is Kloudlite?
Kloudlite is a Development Environment As a Service (DEAAS) platform that providers seemless integration between developer's 
workspaces and remote development environments running in Kubernetes clusters.

## Why use Kloudlite?
Modern applications have become increasingly distributed. They are built using microservices, serverless functions, 
and other cloud-native technologies. This complexity has made development more challenging, with longer development 
loops and greater difficulty in managing these applications.

Kloudlite reduces the need for lengthy build and deployment cycles, allowing developers to focus on coding and innovation, 
thereby improving productivity and efficiency.

### Key Features
- **Enhanced Productivity:** Kloudlite integrates remote and local development setups, reducing lengthy build and deployment cycles, allowing developers to focus more on coding and innovation.
- **Seamless Environment Management:** The platform offers stateless, containerized environments that are easy to create, manage, and discard. This ensures a clean, consistent development environment, minimizing configuration issues.
- **Efficient Testing and Debugging:** With service intercepts, Kloudlite allows traffic tunneling to local containers, enabling early testing and debugging, streamlining the development process.
- **Comprehensive Development Workspace:** The Kloudlite local workspace manages development dependencies, environment variables, network settings, and service intercepts, ensuring a cohesive development environment.
- **Managed Services and Resources:** Kloudlite simplifies the management of backing services like databases and message brokers. It handles connection parameters and variables, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure management.
- **12 Factor Standard:** By leveraging Kubernetes namespaces and operators, Kloudlite ensures robust, scalable, and efficient service management, aligning with modern cloud-native development practices.
- **Flexibility and Scalability:** The ability to easily create and discard environments and manage services through Kubernetes operators provides a flexible and scalable development setup, suitable for a wide range of applications and team sizes.

Kloudlite is designed to optimize development workflows, enhance productivity, and provide a seamless, integrated development environment.

# Integrated Resources:

Integrated Resources inside the environment provides a powerful way to utilize backend services and resources within your environments. This feature allows you to integrate and manage secondary resources from existing integrated services, ensuring that your applications can leverage these resources efficiently while maintaining control over their configurations. These resources are critical for applications that require specific backend services and configurations.

### Usage of Integrated Resource:

From dashboard you can import existing integrated resources into your environments. Developers can use this just like any config and secret.
Each integrated resource provides access details such as connection strings, credentials, and other configuration parameters.You can configure your apps to use these resources to connect to backing service.

**Example**

Assume you have a postgres integrated service created under your account. You can create a database resource under this service and import it into your environment. Once imported you can configure your apps and workspaces to use this resource. This resource contains all the information needed to connect to that particular database.

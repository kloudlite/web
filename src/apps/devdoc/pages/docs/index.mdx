# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with Kloudlite. 
It will show you how to attach your cluster, create an environment, 
set up your workspace to access and intercept services of the environment.

> **Note:** The quickest way to start using Kloudlite is to use our hosted solution. 
Login and set up your free team.

## Quick start

<Steps>
### Create Your Kloudlite Team

To get started with Kloudlite, create a team in Kloudlite dashboard. The team is where you manage your environments, managed services,  infrastructure and devices.

<VideoPlayer src="/docs/getting-started/setup-team.mp4"/>


### Attach Your Cluster

To create development environments and run your workloads, you'll need to attach a Kubernetes cluster to Kloudlite. You can add and manage cluster references from the infrastructure section of the Kloudlite dashboard.

When you log in and select your team using the [Kloudlite CLI](https://github.com/kloudlite/kl) on your local system, Kloudlite will automatically create a default k3s cluster and attach it to your team. This allows developers to get started quickly without needing to provision compute from cloud providers.

**Setting up Kloudlite CLI**

> **Prerequisites:** kl will run docker containers. Make sure you have docker installed and running.

##### Install using curl
```shell
curl 'https://kl.kloudlite.io/kloudlite/kl!?select=kl' | bash
```

##### Login to Kloudlite
```shell
kl auth login
```

<VideoPlayer src="/docs/getting-started/cluster-setup.mp4"/>

*By end of the this step you will have a local k3s cluster installed and attached to kloudlite. You can verify this inside clusters in infrastructure section of your dashboard.*


### Create and Setup an Environment

With cluster attached you can create a new environment in Kloudlite by providing an environment name and the cluster.

*Once environment is created you will be able to create applications and also manage configs and secrets inside the environment.*

#### Managing Configs and Secrets

### Initialize Workspace

Now let's create a workspace to connect to the environment.

##### Choose your workspace directory and create a `kl.yaml` file with the following command:
```shell
mkdir kl-workspace
cd kl-workspace
kl init
```

<VideoPlayer src="/docs/introduction/setup-workspace.mp4"/>

You will be prompted to select kloudlite team and the default environment this workspace will connect to. 
Once selected, a `kl.yml` file with the environment details will be created.

##### You can now add necessary configs, secrets, from the environment to the local workspace with the following commands:

> **Note:** Ensure that you have configs and secrets added to the environment before adding them to the workspace.

```shell
# Add config to your local workspace
kl add config
```

<VideoPlayer src="/docs/introduction/setup-workspace-add-config.mp4"/>


```bash
# Add secret
kl add secret
```

<VideoPlayer src="/docs/introduction/setup-workspace-add-secret.mp4"/>


```bash
# Add configmount
kl add config-mount <file-path>
```
<VideoPlayer src="/docs/introduction/setup-workspace-add-config-mount.mp4"/>

##### You can start and access workspace (development container) using the following command:
```bash
kl box ssh
```
<VideoPlayer src="/docs/introduction/access-intercept-env.mp4"/>


This command creates a development container and mounts your codebase to it. The container will include all necessary 
configs, secrets, resources, and packages. You can now start developing your application.

The container runs an SSH service. You can also attach your IDEs like VSCode or IntelliJ to the container and start 
developing your application.

##### Add necessary packages to the local container using `pkg` command

```bash
# inside development container
kl pkg add nvim

# restart the container to avail the installed package
kl box restart
```

<VideoPlayer src="/docs/introduction/add-packages.mp4"/>

> **Note:** You can search for available packages using `kl pkg search <package-name>` or from [nixhub.io](https://www.nixhub.io/)

### Working with the Workspace

The workspace container is already connected to the environment using wireguard. And also service disvovery 
is configured to resolve the domains of the services in the environment.

As you are in same network now you can access the apps running in the environment using their name. All the configs, secrets, packages are already loaded inside the workspace container.

Now you will be able to access the apps running in the environment using their name. All the configs, secrets, packages are already loaded inside the workspace container.

##### Intercept the traffic of the apps running in the environment using the following command:
```bash
kl intercept start -p <remote-port>:<local-port>
```
You will be prompted to select the app you want to intercept.

<VideoPlayer src="/docs/introduction/select-app.mp4"/>


Now all the traffic to the remote application running in the environment will be 
intercepted and redirected to the local port. 

##### Use the following command to stop the interception:
```bash
kl intercept stop
```

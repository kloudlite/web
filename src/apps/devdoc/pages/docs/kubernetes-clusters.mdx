# Kubernetes Clusters

With Kloudlite, users can attach Kubernetes clusters hosted on public clouds or behind NAT on local machines. Once attached, users can create environments within these clusters and access them from any development machine. Here are the key features:

### Key Features

1. #### Cluster Attachment:
   - Public Cloud and Local Clusters: Support for Kubernetes clusters on public cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) and local machines behind NAT.
   - Secure Connectivity: WireGuard creates a secure, encrypted connection, ensuring reliable communication.

2. #### Environment Creation:
   - Namespace-Based: Environments are created using namespaces within the attached clusters, providing isolated and configurable setups.
   - Configuration and Secrets Syncing: Configurations and secrets are synchronized with local development containers for consistency.

3. #### Access from Development Machines:
   - Seamless Access: Configured DNS search domains allow easy access to services using simple service names.
   - Cross-Device Availability: Environments can be accessed from any connected development machine, ensuring flexibility and mobility.

### Benefits

- Scalability: Utilize both cloud and local resources efficiently.
- Consistency: Maintain development and production parity, reducing environment-specific issues.
- Collaboration: Multiple developers can work in the same environment, enhancing teamwork and productivity.

By enabling the attachment of Kubernetes clusters and providing seamless access to environments from any development machine, Kloudlite enhances the flexibility, scalability, and consistency of development processes.

# What is kloudlite?

Kloudlite is a Development Environment As a Service (DEaaS) platform that provides seamless integration between developer's 
workspaces and application's development environments.

### How Kloudlite works?
Kloudlite creates a secure wireguard network for each team. All the clusters and devices connected to the team are part of
this network. Kloudlite will reconcile and sync the configurations across the network. All the apps in environments and managed 
services created in the team will be accessable from any other workload running in the network.

Apps in the environment can be intercepted and traffic can be redirected to any other ip in the network. This allows developers
to test and debug the apps running in the environment with out building and deploying the code.

To ensure the service discovery, all the apps in the environment and managed serivces are registered with the DNS server running 
in the network. This DNS service is in turn exposed to cloudflare for public access. Because of this all the domains in side the 
VPN can be resolved with out any DNS configurations on the developer's machine.

### Why use kloudlite?
Modern applications have become increasingly distributed. This complexity has made development more challenging, with longer 
development loops and greater difficulty in managing these applications. 

Kloudlite reduces the need for lengthy build and deployment cycles, allowing developers to focus on coding and innovation, 
thereby improving productivity and efficiency.

### Key Features
- **Instant Testing Without Build or Deploy:** Skip the build and deploy steps in your development workflow. Connected workspaces let you instantly test your changes in live environments, streamlining the development process.

- **Seamless Environment Switching:** Effortlessly switch between environments without adjusting configs or connection settings. Stay focused on coding, not setup.

- **Ephemeral and Stateless Environments:** Work independently with lightweight, stateless environments that can be easily cloned. Each developer can run their own environment, ensuring seamless parallel development.

- **Integrated Managed Services:** Easily create and manage stateful backing services, like databases, on attached clusters. Import these resources directly into your environments.

- **Dev Containers with IDE Support:** Develop in SSH-enabled containers that support direct IDE attachment. Manage dependencies effortlessly with the Nix package manager.

- **Collaborative Coding and Debugging:** Collaborate in real-time, working on multiple services across the same environment. Intercept and debug running apps seamlessly for enhanced productivity.

Kloudlite is designed to optimise development workflows, enhance productivity, and provide a seamless, integrated development 
environment.

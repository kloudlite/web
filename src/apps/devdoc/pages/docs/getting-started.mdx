## 4 Steps to Get Started

<Steps>
### Attach Your Cluster
Attach your cluster to Kloudlite using a Helm chart. First, create a cluster reference in Kloudlite, then follow the steps to attach the cluster.

### Create an Environment
Create a new environment in Kloudlite by providing an environment name and the cluster reference. Once your environment is set up, deploy your applications, configure settings, and import resources into the environment.

That's it! Your environment is ready to connect and use.

### Set Up Your Local Machine
Set up your local machine to connect to the environment using the Kloudlite CLI.

First, navigate to your workspace and create a `kl.yaml` file with the following command:

```bash
kl init
```

You will be prompted to select the environment you want to connect to. Once selected, a `kl.yaml` file with the environment details will be created.

Next, import the necessary configs, secrets, and resources. You can also create config mounts. Use the following commands:

```bash
# Add config to your local workspace
kl add config

# Add secret to your local workspace
kl add secret

# Add resource to your local workspace
kl add mres

# Add config mount to your local workspace
kl mount config

# Add secret mount to your local workspace
kl mount secret
```

Add necessary packages to the local container using the command:

```bash
kl add package <package-name>
```

### Access & Intercept!

Access the development container with the following command:

```bash
kl box ssh
```

This command creates a development container and mounts your codebase to it. The container will include all necessary configs, secrets, resources, and packages. You can now start developing your application.

The container runs an SSH service. You will receive the domain name and port to connect to the container.

Attach your IDEs like VSCode or IntelliJ to the container and start developing your application.

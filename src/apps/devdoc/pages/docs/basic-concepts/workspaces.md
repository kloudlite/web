## Workspaces - The Developer's Toolkit

A workspace is the collection of tools, configurations, and resources that a developer uses to write, test, and debug code. It includes everything needed to develop an application from the developer's perspective.

#### Components of workspace:
- **Code Editors/IDEs:** Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or PyCharm.
- **Source Code:** The actual codebase of the application being developed.
- **Build Tools:** Tools and scripts used to compile and build the application.
- **Dependencies:** Libraries and packages required by the application.
- **Configurations:** Settings and preferences for the development tools and the application.
- **Version Control:** Integration with systems like Git to manage code versions.

The primary purpose of a workspace is to provide a developer with a personalised and optimised setup for writing and testing code. It ensures that the developer has all the necessary tools and configurations at their fingertips, enabling a smooth and efficient coding process.

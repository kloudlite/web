# Collabarate on Demand

As all the workloads running are on the same network now developers can easily collaborate with each other. 
Developers can share their environment with other developers and they can start working on the same environment. 
So now there is no need for developers to wait for the dependent services to be deployed by other developers to start
working on their feature.

# Environments

Effective platform engineering practices should reduce developer's cognitive load and enable them to focus on coding and innovation. 
Kloudlite's development environment as a service (DEaaS) platform is designed to optimize the development workflow by integrating 
remote and local development setups.

With kloudlite environments, there is no need to setup local dependent services. Instead developers can directly use the services running
in remote environment as if they are running locally. As DNS resolution will be managed by kloudlite, developers will not have to worry about
managing and switching the service endpoints.

All the configs and secrets are managed as part of environment. So there is no need to manage them in your code and switch them when 
switching environments.

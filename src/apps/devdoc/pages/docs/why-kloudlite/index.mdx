# The `Why?` Answer

Modern applications have become increasingly distributed. They are built using microservices, serverless functions, and other cloud-native technologies. This complexity has made development more challenging, with longer development loops and greater difficulty in managing these applications.

Developers must handle multiple services, configurations, and secrets, resulting in a complex and error-prone development process. To build distributed applications effectively, developers need a development environment that simplifies these tasks, allowing them to focus on creating features and delivering value.

Kloudlite is the perfect solution to these challenges. It is a developer tool that simplifies the development of modern applications by offering a unified development environment that is consistent, reproducible, and secure.

Kloudlite ensures that the developer's IDE operates with the same:

- Dependent services
- Network configurations
- Configs and secret mounts
- Environment variables

as the production environment.

By aligning the development environment closely with the production setup, Kloudlite eliminates the discrepancies and errors that typically arise during deployment. This alignment allows developers to concentrate on what truly matters: building and delivering high-quality features.

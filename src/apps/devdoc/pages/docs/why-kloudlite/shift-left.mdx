# Shift Left Testing


*Shift Left* approach is crucial in modern development practices. Shifting left means integrating testing and quality checks early in the development process rather than at the end. This approach helps identify and resolve issues sooner, reducing the risk of defects and improving the overall quality of the application.

Using kloudlite makes it more effective to implement shift-left practices. When developers can test their changes in real-time without the need for repeated build and deployment cycles, they receive immediate feedback, allowing them to address issues as they code. This leads to faster iterations, more reliable code, and a significant reduction in the time and effort required to deliver high-quality software.

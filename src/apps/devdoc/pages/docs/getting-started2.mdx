# Getting Started
This guide will help you get started with Kloudlite. 
It will show you how to attach your cluster, create an environment, 
set up your workspace to access and intercept services of the environment.

> **Note:** The quickest way to start using Kloudlite is to use our hosted solution. Login and set up your free account.

## Quick start

<br />

<Steps>
### Attach Your Cluster

Attach your cluster in infrastructure section of Kloudlite dashboard by providing the cluster name and visibility.

Follow the instructions to attach the cluster
<img src="/attach-cluster-2.png" alt="" className="wb-p-3xl wb-mt-3xl wb-bg-white" />
Above instructions will help you install the Kloudlite agent on your cluster and connect it to Kloudlite. Once connected 
it will come online.

> **Important Note:** You need to have capability to run pods with [NetAdmin capililities](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) for kloudlite to 
run wireguard and intercept services.

<br />

### Create and Setup an Environment
Create a new environment in Kloudlite by providing an environment name and the cluster 
reference.

#### Once environment is created you can 
- Create applications
- Add configs and secrets

<br />

### Install Kloudlite CLI
Kloudlite CLI is a command line tool that allows you to interact with Kloudlite. 
It provides a set of commands to manage workspaces and access environments.

> **Prerequisites:** kl will run docker containers. Make sure you have docker installed.

##### Install using curl
```bash
curl 'https://kl.kloudlite.io/kloudlite/kl!?select=kl' | bash
```
##### Login to Kloudlite
```bash
kl auth login
```
For detailed guide you can refer to [kl repository](https://github.com/kloudlite/kl)
<br />

### Set Up Your Workspace

Once `kl` is installed and authenticated, you can set up your workspace to connect to the environment.

##### Choose your workspace directory and create a `kl.yaml` file with the following command:
```bash
mkdir kl-workspace
cd kl-workspace
kl init
```

You will be prompted to select kloudlite account and the default environment this workspace will connect to. Once selected, a `kl.yml` file with the environment details will be created.



> **Note:** Ensure that you have configs and secrets added to the environment before adding them to the local workspace.
##### You can now add necessary configs, secrets, from the environment to the local workspace with the following commands:

```bash
# Add config to your local workspace
kl add config
```

```bash
# Add secret
kl add secret
```

```bash
# Add configmount
kl add config-mount <file-path>
```

##### Add necessary packages to the local container using `pkg` command

```bash
kl pkg add nvim
```
> **Note:** You can search for available packages using `kl pkg search <package-name>` or from [nixhub.io](https://www.nixhub.io/)

<br />

### Access & Intercept Environment


As we have configured our workspace you can start and connect to your workspace


##### You can start and access workspace (development container) using the following command:
```bash
kl box ssh
```

This command creates a development container and mounts your codebase to it. The container will include all necessary configs, secrets, resources, and packages. You can now start developing your application.

The container runs an SSH service. You can also attach your IDEs like VSCode or IntelliJ to the container and start developing your application.

> **Note:** The running container is already connected to the environment using wireguard. And also service disvovery is configured
to resolve the domains of the services in the environment.

As you are in same network now you can access the apps running in the environment using their name.

##### Intercept the traffic of the apps running in the environment using the following command:
```bash
kl intercept start -p <remote-port>:<local-port>
```
You will be prompted to select the app you want to intercept.

Now all the traffic to the remote application running in the environment will be 
intercepted and redirected to the local port. 

##### Use the following command to stop the interception:
```bash
kl intercept stop
```

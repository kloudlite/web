# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

We are currently working on implementation of IaC for managing infrastructure as code. 
This will help us to manage infrastructure in a more efficient way and also help us to
maintain the infrastructure in a more consistent state.

This feature is planed to be implemented in the next release. You can track our progress
in the GitHub project board.

# What is Kloudlite InfraOps?

Kloudlite InfraOps is a platform designed to streamline the creation and management
of Infrastructure across various public cloud providers. By automating complex
processes in infrastructure management and maintenance, Kloudlite enhances the efficiency of
deploying, scaling, and managing infrastructure environments.

## Kubernetes Clusters

Kloudlite Kubernetes clusters are designed to be lightweight, secure, and easy to manage.
The platform leverages k3s, a lightweight and easy-to-install Kubernetes distribution,
as the base for building Kubernetes clusters. This approach ensures a simplified yet
robust orchestration solution, ideal for both small and large-scale deployments.

### Core Features
- **Built on k3s:** Kloudlite leverages k3s, a lightweight and easy-to-install Kubernetes
distribution, as the base for building Kubernetes clusters. This approach ensures a
simplified yet robust orchestration solution, ideal for both small and large-scale deployments.
- **Enhanced with Operators:** Kloudlite integrates a range of operators to effectively manage and
maintain clusters. These operators automate various administrative and maintenance tasks, optimizing
the clusters for cost, resilience, scalability, and up-to-date operations.

### Capabilities
Kloudlite is equipped with features that significantly enhance Kubernetes usability:
- **Inbuilt WireGuard VPN:** Provides secure and streamlined access to services within
Kubernetes clusters, facilitating easier and faster application development by reducing
development loop times.
- **Cluster Autoscaling:** Adapts to workload fluctuations dynamically. Kloudlite's cluster
autoscaling automatically adjusts the number of nodes in a nodepool, ensuring resource
utilization is efficient and responsive to current needs.
- **Spot Instance Management:** Offers sophisticated management of spot instances, enabling users
to utilize lower-cost computing resources without compromising on reliability. This feature is key in
optimizing both cost and performance.
- **Cloud Provider-Specific Storage Drivers:** Kloudlite seamlessly integrates with storage solutions from
various cloud providers. This ensures that Kubernetes clusters can leverage the most suitable storage options
available, customized to the specific requirements of the cloud environment in use.
- **Cloud Provider-Specific Load Balancers:** Enhances performance and reliability through support for cloud
provider-specific load balancers. This allows for more effective distribution of network traffic and improved
responsiveness of applications.

With these features, Kloudlite facilitates the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters with increased
ease, efficiency, and security, catering to a wide range of public cloud environments.

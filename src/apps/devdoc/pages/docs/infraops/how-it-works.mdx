# How Kloudlite InfraOps works ?

The InfraOps module is a core component of the Kloudlite platform,
designed to facilitate efficient infrastructure management.
This module primarily consists of **Kubernetes Cluster Controllers** which
play a crucial role in interfacing with various cloud providers.

## Cluster Controllers
- **Communication with Cloud Providers:** The cluster controllers are engineered
to communicate effectively with different cloud providers. This communication is key
to orchestrating and managing cloud resources.
- **Creating Linux Instances:** These controllers have the capability to create Linux
instances across desired regions. This feature allows for a high degree of flexibility
and scalability, adapting to the geographical and computational needs of different projects.
- **Forming Kubernetes Clusters:** Once instances are created, the controllers proceed to
join these instances, culminating in the formation of a fully operational Kubernetes cluster.

## NodePool Controller
- **Located in Tenant Clusters:** The NodePool controller operates within the tenant clusters
created by the InfraOps module.
- **Managing NodePools:** This controller is responsible for a range of critical tasks, including
the creation, scaling up, and scaling down of NodePools. These operations are essential for maintaining
the efficiency and responsiveness of the Kubernetes clusters.
- **Integration with Autoscalers and Deschedulers:** To optimize costs and improve the distribution of
workloads, the NodePool controllers are backed by advanced tools such as cluster autoscalers and deschedulers.
These tools ensure that resources are utilized optimally, reducing waste and enhancing performance.

### Capabilities
Kloudlite is equipped with features that significantly enhance Kubernetes usability:
- **Inbuilt WireGuard VPN:** Provides secure and streamlined access to services within
Kubernetes clusters, facilitating easier and faster application development by reducing
development loop times.
- **Cluster Autoscaling:** Adapts to workload fluctuations dynamically. Kloudlite's cluster
autoscaling automatically adjusts the number of nodes in a nodepool, ensuring resource
utilization is efficient and responsive to current needs.
- **Spot Instance Management:** Offers sophisticated management of spot instances, enabling users
to utilize lower-cost computing resources without compromising on reliability. This feature is key in
optimizing both cost and performance.
- **Cloud Provider-Specific Storage Drivers:** Kloudlite seamlessly integrates with storage solutions from
various cloud providers. This ensures that Kubernetes clusters can leverage the most suitable storage options
available, customized to the specific requirements of the cloud environment in use.
- **Cloud Provider-Specific Load Balancers:** Enhances performance and reliability through support for cloud
provider-specific load balancers. This allows for more effective distribution of network traffic and improved
responsiveness of applications.

With these features, Kloudlite facilitates the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters with increased
ease, efficiency, and security, catering to a wide range of public cloud environments.

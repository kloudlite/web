# Architecture

## Platform Overview

Kloudlite platform consists of graphql federation on top of APIs. This graphql will serve frontend portal and
Kloudlite CLI. 

APIs will take care of managing the resources and configurations across the network.

All communication with the clusters is done through the Message Office, which operates on top of the NATS 
streaming server. Within each cluster, the Kloudlite agent and operators are responsible for reconciling 
resources and configurations.

Kloudlite APIs also serve DNS queries for service discovery in the network.

## Network Overview
Kloudlite creates a secure wireguard network for each team. All the clusters and devices in the team are part of
this network connected via wireguard edge gateway. 

Kloudlite will reconcile and sync the configurations across the network. All the apps in environments and managed 
services created in the team will be accessable from any other workload running in the network.

Each pod and device is assigned a unique IP address, and all services are exposed with a unique IP, ensuring 
seamless access and communication. 

> **Note:** To avoid any conflicts with existing networks, all the ip addresses are in a private range of 100.64.0.0/10.

*All devices, clusters and developer's workspaces of a team are connected to wireguard mesh*

*In kubernetes clusters all apps in the environments and workloads of managed services are connected to 
wireguard mesh via wireguard gateway. And all the services managed by kloudlite will be exposed to wireguard
network via reverse proxy running in gateway container*

***Note:** Workspace is connected to wireguard mesh as a wireguard device.*

#### App Intercept
Apps in the environment can be intercepted and traffic can be redirected to any other ip in the network. This allows developers 
to test and debug the apps running in the environment with out building and deploying the code.

#### Service Discovery
To ensure the service discovery, all the apps in the environment and managed serivces are registered with the DNS server running 
in the network. This DNS service is in turn exposed to cloudflare for public access. Because of this all the domains in side the 
VPN can be resolved with out any DNS configurations on the developer's machine.

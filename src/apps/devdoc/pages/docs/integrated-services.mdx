# Managed Services & Resources

## Managed Services

Kloudlite's Managed Services provide a streamlined and standardized approach to deploying 
and managing commonly used backend services such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. With just 
a few clicks, these services can be easily set up and managed by Kloudlite operators installed in 
clusters.

## Managed Resources
Managed Resources are sub-resources created on these managed services. For example, a 
database is an managed resource that can be created on a database service.

Kloudlite simplifies the creation and management of these resources, enabling users to easily control 
access and define roles for their applications on the services.

This functionality allows developers to quickly set up and start building applications without worrying 
about maintaining these backend services.

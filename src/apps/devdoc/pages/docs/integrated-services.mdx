# Integrated Services & Resources

## Services

Kloudlite's Integrated Services provide a streamlined and standardized approach to deploying and managing commonly used backend services such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. With just a few clicks, these services can be easily set up and managed by Kloudlite operators installed in clusters.

## Resources
Integrated Resources are sub-resources created on these integrated services. For example, a database is an integrated resource that can be created on a database service.

Kloudlite simplifies the creation and management of these resources, enabling users to easily control access and define roles for their applications on the services.

This functionality allows developers to quickly set up and start building applications without worrying about maintaining these backend services.
